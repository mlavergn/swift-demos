# swift-demos
Collection of bare bones Swift demo apps for reference purposes

These are no Xcode projects in this repo, just the minimal Swift code, usually in Swift script form.

These are maintained to demonstrate in a concise way how to implement various features programmatically.

NOTE: These use Swift 3.0 syntax
